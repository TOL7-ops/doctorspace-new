## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

The system uses the existing `appointments` table with enhanced filtering:

```sql
-- Upcoming appointments (pending + confirmed, future dates)
SELECT * FROM appointments 
WHERE patient_id = ? 
  AND date >= CURRENT_DATE 
  AND status IN ('pending', 'confirmed')
  AND status != 'cancelled'
  AND status != 'completed'

-- Past appointments (completed only)
SELECT * FROM appointments 
WHERE patient_id = ? 
  AND status = 'completed'

-- Cancelled appointments
SELECT * FROM appointments 
WHERE patient_id = ? 
  AND status = 'cancelled'
```

### Component Structure

```
AppointmentsClient.tsx
├── Tab Navigation (Upcoming | Past | Cancelled)
├── Clear History Buttons
├── Appointment Cards
│   ├── Status Badges
│   ├── Action Buttons (context-aware)
│   └── Appointment Details
└── Modals
    ├── ConfirmationModal (Cancel/Clear)
    ├── RescheduleModal

```

### State Management

```typescript
interface LocalAppointments {

  past: Appointment[]
  cancelled: Appointment[]
}

type TabType = 'upcoming' | 'past' | 'cancelled'
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
