# Notification Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The new appointment booking system (`/appointments/doctor/[doctorId]`) was not creating notifications when appointments were booked, unlike the old booking system which had proper notification functionality.

## Root Cause
When creating the new appointment booking page, the notification creation logic was not included in the `handleBookAppointment` function, while the old booking page (`/book-appointment`) had this functionality.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Notification Import
```typescript
import { createAppointmentNotification } from '@/lib/notifications';
```

### 2. Added Audio Reference
```typescript
const audioRef = useRef<HTMLAudioElement | null>(null);
```

### 3. Updated Appointment Creation
Modified the appointment creation to return the created appointment data:
```typescript
const { data: appointmentData, error: appointmentError } = await supabase
  .from('appointments')
  .insert({
    patient_id: user.id,
    doctor_id: doctorId,
    appointment_type_id: selectedType,
    date: selectedDate,
    start_time: selectedTime,
    notes: notes.trim() || undefined,
    status: 'pending'
  })
  .select()
  .single();
```

### 4. Added Notification Creation
Added notification creation after successful appointment booking:
```typescript
// Create notification for the appointment (only on client side)
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  try {
    await createAppointmentNotification(
      user.id,
      doctor?.full_name || 'Your doctor',
      selectedDate,
      selectedTime,
      appointmentData?.id
    );
  } catch (notificationError) {
    console.error('Error creating notification:', notificationError);
    // Don't fail the appointment booking if notification fails
  }
}
```

### 5. Added Audio Element
Added the audio element for notification sounds:
```typescript
{/* Notification sound (hidden) */}
<audio
  ref={audioRef}
  src="/notification.mp3"
  preload="auto"
  style={{ display: 'none' }}
  onError={() => toast('ðŸ”” (Notification sound not supported in this browser)', { icon: 'ðŸ”•' })}
/>
```

### 6. Added Audio Playback
Added audio playback after successful booking:
```typescript
// Play notification sound (with fallback)
if (audioRef.current) {
  audioRef.current.currentTime = 0;
  audioRef.current.play().catch(() => {});
}
```

## Notification Flow

1. **User books appointment** through new doctor page
2. **Appointment created** in database with returned data
3. **Notification created** using `createAppointmentNotification()`
4. **Real-time subscription** triggers in DashboardLayout
5. **Notification appears** in NotificationsSheet component
6. **Audio plays** for immediate feedback
7. **Toast shows** success message
8. **User redirected** to appointments page

## Notification Content

The notification includes:
- **Title**: "Appointment Confirmed"
- **Message**: "Your appointment with [Doctor Name] has been confirmed for [Date] at [Time]. Please arrive 10 minutes early."
- **Type**: "appointment"
- **Priority**: "medium"
- **Metadata**: Doctor name, date, time, appointment ID

## Error Handling

- **Notification errors** don't fail appointment booking
- **Audio errors** show fallback message
- **Database errors** are properly logged
- **User gets appropriate** error messages

## Testing

### Automated Tests
- Created test scripts to verify notification functionality
- All notification components working correctly
- Real-time subscriptions functioning

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. Navigate to dashboard
2. Click on a doctor image or name
3. Fill out appointment booking form
4. Submit the form
5. Verify notification appears in bell icon
6. Check notification sound plays
7. Verify notification content is correct
8. Test notification interactions (mark read, delete)

## Files Modified

1. **`/appointments/doctor/[doctorId]/page.tsx`**
   - Added notification import
   - Added audio reference
   - Updated appointment creation
   - Added notification creation
   - Added audio element and playback

2. **Test Scripts**
